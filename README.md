consilient
==========

Consilient is a development harness

Thoughts
--------
This project is aiming to create a development tool to automate documentation creation to code to test implementation.

It is similar to ATDD tools, like Cucumber or FitNess. The reason why I create this is that I need not only development/testing common methodology support tool, but a tool that support my thoughts of development cycle.

The initial thoughts is:
0. Dev gets product design ready.
1. Dev writes documentation contains: principles, terms, usages, and examples.
2. Consilient help to create stubs where dev fill them to get ATDD input, as well as other input ready.
3. Dev then write glue code and testing code for prodcut.
4. Dev write production code untill all tests pass.


Worklogs
--------
Consilient should not be a full stack solution, but involve other framework or tools to get things done, therefore, I need to evaluate and choose proper tools for different steps. 

Those trials and worklogs are stored in <code>worklogs/ToolsChoosing.MD</code>
